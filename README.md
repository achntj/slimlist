# Your Local Second Brain

SlimList is a fast, minimal list and task manager built for clarity, focus, and
full control (it's a glorified Todo List).

Most productivity tools are bloated. SlimList is lightweight, local, and
distraction-free. It gives you a private, organized space for everything from
daily tasks to long-term planning.
